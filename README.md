## Installation Instructions

#### Option 1: Install via Homebridge Config UI X:

#### Option 2: Manually Install:

```
sudo npm install -g homebridge-gsh
```

## Configuration

To configure `homebridge-gsh` you must also be running [homebridge-config-ui-x](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x).

1. Navigate to the Plugins page in [homebridge-config-ui-x](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x).
2. Click the **Settings** button for the Google Smart Home plugin.
3. Click the **Link Account** button.
4. Sign in with your Google or GitHub account.
5. Your account is now linked.

7. Add the [Homebridge Action](https://assistant.google.com/services/a/uid/000000b558f0d5d1?hl=en) using the Google Home mobile app. [See Wiki](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-gsh/wiki#add-homebridge-to-google-home-app) for detailed instructions.

### Enabling Accessory Control

Homebridge must be running in insecure mode to allow accessory control via this plugin. See [Enabling Accessory Control](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x/wiki/Enabling-Accessory-Control) for instructions.

### Multiple Homebridge Instances

This plugin **must** only be configured on one Homebridge instance on your network as the plugin will discover all your other Homebridge instances and be able to control them. For this to work:

* all instances must be running [in insecure mode](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x/wiki/Enabling-Accessory-Control)
* all instances must have the same PIN defined in the `config.json`

## Known Issues

1. Only one Homebridge instance can be linked to an account (even across different local networks). You will experience unintended results if you try and link more than one instance to the same account.

## Troubleshooting

#### 1. Errors during installation

Make sure you installed the package with `sudo` flag. Most installation errors can be fixed by removing the plugin and reinstalling:

```shell
# cleanup
sudo npm uninstall -g homebridge-gsh

# reinstall
sudo npm install -g homebridge-gsh
```

#### 2. Cannot control accessories

See [Enabling Accessory Control](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x/wiki/Enabling-Accessory-Control) and [Multiple Homebridge Instances](#multiple-homebridge-instances).

#### 3. Ask on Discord

Join the [Official Homebridge Discord](https://discord.gg/cFFBuvp) community and ask in the [#homebridge-gsh](https://discord.gg/cFFBuvp) channel.
